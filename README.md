In this assignment you will create your own game! You can choose your own game or one of the following:

- War (the card game)
- Blackjack
- Connect Four
- Mancala
- A picture matching game ex: www.memozor.com/memory-games/for-adults/vegetables 
- Tic Tac Toe 
- expand on choose your own adventure game to include text, images and buttons, score 
- Number guessing game 

### Requirements:
- user interaction causes changes to the web page using DOM methods (at least 3 changes during game play) can be images, text, score indicator 
- correct use of at least 1 JavaScript Class that is used in the game 
- use of a method defined in your class 
- declare if the user won or lost at the end of the game and display on the page besides any global variables, all your code should be contained in functions and classes 
- Use of CSS to set colors, fonts and overall layout of the page
- use of iteration. examples: for loop, while loop, forEach method, .map method
**Edit 10/26 keeping score is NOT required 

#### Note: 
- your project's code must be substantially yours. While it can be tempting, please do not copy code from other similar projects.
- Once you even look at someone else's solution, it becomes hard to come up with your own original solution, and that's the whole point :~) 
- However, relying on techniques and a line of code here and there found on Stack Overflow or other resources is okay!   

#### Getting started:
- Think about how you'd like your game to work. How will the user interact with your webpage? Start with wireframing and flow-charting - see example figma file attached
- write pseudo-code for your game's logic.

#### Optional:
- game allows for 2 players, keeps score of each player and announces a winner 
- use of animations 

#### Instructions for Submission:
submit link to Github repo
